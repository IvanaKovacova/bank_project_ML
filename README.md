# final_project_DS
Final project from data science course
This project was created as a final project when I started learning Data Science.
The dataset was obtained here: 
[Moro et al., 2014] S. Moro, P. Cortez and P. Rita. A Data-Driven Approach to Predict the Success of Bank Telemarketing. Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 62:22-31, June 2014.
Note: I was just assigned the dataset and needed to create a model based on what I learned during the course myself. The model needs to predict whether bank customers will or will not take a loan based on a campaign.
